# Humanoid-Finger-Curling
I'm working on programming a humanoid finger to curl accurately. The finger incorporates tendon-driven controls with 2 tendon, each controlling flexion and extension, respectively. This code was written in Arduino IDE for the ESP32-S3 Board and uses servo motors to control the tendon positions.
